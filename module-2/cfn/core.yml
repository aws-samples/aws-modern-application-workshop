Description: This stack deploys the core network infrastructure and IAM resources
             to be used for a service hosted in Amazon ECS using AWS Fargate.

Mappings:
  # Hard values for the subnet masks. These masks define
  # the range of internal IP addresses that can be assigned.
  # The VPC can have all IP's from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255
  # There are four subnets which cover the ranges:
  #
  # 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.255
  # 10.0.1.0 - 10.0.1.255
  # 10.0.2.0 - 10.0.2.255
  # 10.0.3.0 - 10.0.3.255
  #
  # If you need more IP addresses (perhaps you have so many
  # instances that you run out) then you can customize these
  # ranges to add more
